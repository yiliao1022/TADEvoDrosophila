# Comparative Topologically associating domains (TADs) analysis in Drosophila species

Topologically associating domains (TADs), are regarded as both functional and physical units of the organizational features, play a vital role in genome function (e.g. gene regulation), strucuture (e.g. chromosomal arrangements) and evolution.It was originally discovered in Hi-C contact maps as domains within which DNA sequences physically contact each other more densely than they are outside (Sexton et al. 2012; Dixon et al. 2012).
