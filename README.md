# Comparative Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) analysis in Drosophila species

Topologically associating domains (TADs) are regarded as both functional and physical units of the organizational features, play a vital role in genome function (e.g. gene regulation), strucuture (e.g. chromosomal rearrangements) and evolution.They were originally discovered in Hi-C contact maps as domains within which DNA sequences physically contact each other more densely than they are outside (Sexton et al. 2012; Dixon et al. 2012). TADs or the similar domains were widely observed across the kingdom of the life. 

This collection of command-line scrips is to run the methods we used in our work "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.094516v1" for analyses:

1   TAD annotation using Armatus,Arrowhead in the Juicer package,and HiCExplorer;
2   Evaltuion of TAD conservation degree within and between species regarding TAD boundaries,entire TAD body and Genome coverage;
3   Identification of Synteny breaks using whole genome alignment based on LASTZ/CHAIN/NET/NETSYNTENY tools;
4   Identification of Structural variants(SVs) using genome assemblies; 
5   Gene expression analysis;
6   TADs-SVs analysis.
